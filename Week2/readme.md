GladLibs: Stories from Templates Module

After completing this module, you will be able to:

    Program a word frequency counter to analyze any input text file;
    Select and substitute words from a list into a document template using both ArrayList and HashMap;
    Create new lists to use in templates;
    Recognize brittle code; and
    Improve code with flexible, object-oriented design.

You will gain these skills in the framework of developing a randomly generated story that we call GladLibs. You may discover that bald lions change peoplesâ€™ lives, or that fluffy dinosaurs get things done in a jiffy. We hope you have fun developing your Java skills this week!
