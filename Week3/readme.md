Web Server Logs Module

In this module, you will learn about how web server logs store information about visitors to a website, and you will write programs to access information like user IP address, date and time of access, and more.

Using Java programs you write in this module, you will be able to:

    Read information from a web server log;
    Count the number of unique visitors to your website; and
    Count the number of times each visitor uses your website.
